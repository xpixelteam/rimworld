Colors the items in the trade window based on quality.

Super simple mod, just colors items based on quality. Currently works on:
- Trade window
- Caravan packing window
- Quality labels on the ground
- Inspect pane (Bottom left window when you select something)

Features settings, allowing you to change the color to your hearts desire!

Also features the following presets:
- Legacy (Featured in Preview, the first colors the mod used)
- Default (New and improved colors)
- WoW (Rarity colors used in World of Warcraft)
- Colorblind (My best attempt at colorblindness-friendly colors)
- Final Fantasy 14 (Contributed by Erin)

Should be compatible with everything.
