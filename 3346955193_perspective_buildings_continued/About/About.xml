This mod adds a gizmo to most buildings which allows the player to adjust its position. For example, you can nudge a building down a bit and tuck it behind a wall, giving it a better sense of perspective.

It also allows you to mirror non-rotatable buildings.

This mod was originally created for the new [b]Fencepost Lights[/b] added to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2565545335]Simple Utilities: Walls[/url]

[h1]Limitations[/h1]
This is purely a graphical mod and does not impact the gameplay. It can be added or removed at any time.

The main limitation is that associated objects, like meals on tables, do not respect the offset... At least not yet, I'm still looking into fixing that.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
[list]
[*]Not compatible with [b]Graphic Chair Overhaul[/b] (at least for chairs) due to its custom drawing routine.
[/list]

[h1]For other modders[/h1]
Unless custom specified, buildings get a list of [i]standard offsets[/i] that the adjuster button iterates through. If you're a modder and would like to add custom offsets to your building, [url=https://github.com/Owlchemist/perspective-buildings/wiki]check the wiki[/url] for documentation.

[h1]Credits[/h1]
[list]
[*]German translation by Dimos
