- hotfix for CE;

4.1.revamp.6.4
- made so mod handles unsupported raceprops a bit more aggressively. By that I mean by default non-humanline raceprops are reverted to basic (vanilla) tab view;
- shuffled some code around to possibly save a fps or two;
- added dev tool button (from vanilla);
- made some tiny little GUI alignment adjustments;
Hope it doesn't break nothing, have a nice day you all.

4.1.revamp.6.3
- minor fix for cases when "health background" is used and for some reason apparel hp is higher than max hp;

4.1.revamp.6.2
- CE post-1.5 support;

4.1.revamp.6.1
- because atm Rimworld of Magic wasn't up to date, support for it was temp removed. But because I didn't touch the source for a long of time I didn't do it properly and it lead to mod getting broken instead, whoops. Now since RWoM is back up, restoring the support;

4.1.revamp.6
- for 1.5. I guess it works?;

4.1.revamp.5.8
- fixed a button to consume drug from inventory. One of the checks was changed so drugs now never count as "edible" (meaning like a food), but checked separately as a "consumable drug";
