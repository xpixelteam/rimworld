  <!-- EN: Weathered electrical appliances once used in an ancient tunnel boring machines. Back in its haydays, it was capable of converting electricity into hydraulic power, thus powering up the drilling behemoth at one flick of switch. With its core components rusted and weathered, however, it just woudn't function as of now.Destroying it may yield some useful resources. -->

  <!-- EN: The rusted, gigantic husk of an ancient tunnel boring machine. Bearing a horrible look more like a sandworm on the outside, it was used to dig through the mountains in the mean time of building tunnels. Back into its haydays, every motion of this behemoth trembles the ground more like manmade earthquake, plus its imposing digging disk that could eat through any material with ease. With its core components rusted and weathered, however, it just woudn't function as of now.Destroying it may yield some useful resources. -->
